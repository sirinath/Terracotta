      <!-- Our app requires these custom objects/classes to be shared - the following declarations
           tells DSO which ones they are. When the app runs under DSO, instances of these classes
           will broadcast changes in their state.

           A good idiom when writing an app that you intend to cluster via TC DSO, is to group the 
           classes you wish to share under a single package (although if you follow the MVC pattern
           this tends to happen naturally) - this way the list of classes you wish to instrument
           can be concise -->
      <instrumented-classes>
        <!-- Here we are saying that the class 'demo.chatter.MessageManager' is to be shared, but 
             that fields described in the class as 'transient' should still behave as transient fields.

             When we tell DSO to honor transients (by setting the value of the  'honor-transient'
             field to 'true'), fields declared as transient *are* transient - its state and value
             will not become available across instances of the app. Only local instances of the app
             will be able to create, read, and write (to) these fields.

             In the 'demo.chatter.MessageManager' we happen to initialize most of its members
             (transient and otherwise) upon creation. However, when DSO finds that an object is already
             available from the server, additional instances of the app will simply receive a reference 
             to that object, and its constructor will not be called - transient fields will not be 
             initialized at this point, so we use the 'on-load' declaration to indicate actions
             that the class need to take when DSO loads that object from the server (actions that normally
             happens on class instantiation) -->

                 is created (via its constructor), or loaded/retrieved from the server by DSO
                 for a new instance of the app; -->
