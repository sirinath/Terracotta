      <!-- Our app requires these custom objects/classes to be shared - the following declarations
           tells DSO which ones they are. When the app runs under DSO, instances of these classes
           will broadcast changes in their state.

           A good idiom when writing an app thay you intend to cluster via TC DSO, is to group the 
           classes you wish to share under a single package (although if you follow the MVC pattern
           this tends to happen naturally) - this way the list of classes you wish to instrument
           can be concise 

           Here we're telling DSO to instrument all of the classes found under the 'demo.inventory'
           package -->
      <instrumented-classes>
        <include>
          <class-expression>demo.inventory..*</class-expression>
        </include>
      </instrumented-classes>

      <!-- These methods (originating from local objects) operates on objects declared as shared. This 
           section tells DSO to assume a lock on those objects for the duration of the call; essentially this
           section declares that all methods found in the 'demo.inventory.Main' class should assume the 
           behavior described -->
      <locks>
        <autolock>
          <method-expression>* demo.inventory.Main*.*(..)</method-expression>
          <lock-level>write</lock-level>
        </autolock>
      </locks>

      <!-- We declare the field 'demo.inventory.Main.stores' a root, making it 
           available for all instances of our app that runs via DSO -->
      <roots>
        <root>
          <field-name>demo.inventory.Main.store</field-name>
        </root>
      </roots>
