      <!-- Our app requires these custom objects/classes to be shared - the following declarations
           tells DSO which ones they are. When the app runs under DSO, instances of these classes
           will broadcast changes in their state.

           A good idiom when writing an app thay you intend to cluster via TC DSO, is to group the 
           classes you wish to share under a single package (although if you follow the MVC pattern
           this tends to happen naturally) - this way the list of classes you wish to instrument
           can be concise 

           Here, we're basically telling DSO to instrument all of the classes for all packages found -->

           section tells DSO to assume a lock on those objects for the duration of the call; essentially this
           section declares that all methods found in the 'demo.inventory.Main' class should assume the 
           behavior described -->

           The field 'demo.sharedqueue.Main.lastPortUsed' keeps track of the last port number
           used to launch the web server - subsequent instances of the application will use
           the next port number in the sequence to avoid collision with previous instances -->
