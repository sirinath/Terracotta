           tells DSO which ones they are. When the app runs under DSO, instances of these classes
           will broadcast changes in their state.

           A good idiom when writing an app that you intend to cluster via TC DSO, is to group the 
           classes you wish to share under a single package (although if you follow the MVC pattern
           this tends to happen naturally) - this way the list of classes you wish to instrument
           can be concise -->
      <instrumented-classes>
        <include>
          <class-expression>*..*</class-expression>
        </include>
      </instrumented-classes>

      <!-- These methods (originating from local objects) operates on objects declared as shared. This 
           section tells DSO to assume a lock on those objects for the duration of the call; essentially this
           section declares that all methods found for all classes found for all packages should assume the 
           behavior described -->
