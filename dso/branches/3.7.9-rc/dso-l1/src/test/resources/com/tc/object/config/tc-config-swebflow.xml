             tells DSO which ones they are. When the app runs under DSO, instances of these classes
             will broadcast changes in their state.

             A good idiom when writing an app that you intend to cluster via TC DSO, is to group the 
             classes you wish to share under a single package (although if you follow the MVC pattern
             this tends to happen naturally) - this way the list of classes you wish to instrument
             can be concise -->
        <instrumented-classes>
          <include>
            <!-- Here, we say, instrument the 'demo.webflow.WebFlowBean' bean class -->
            <class-expression>demo.webflow.WebFlowBean</class-expression>
