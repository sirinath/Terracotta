--------------------
Terracotta clusters can be run with any supported JRE.  The product guide
contains a list of supported JREs.  The JRE used by Terracotta Clients need not
match the one used by the Terracotta Server. Control the JVM that the Terracotta Server
uses by setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
