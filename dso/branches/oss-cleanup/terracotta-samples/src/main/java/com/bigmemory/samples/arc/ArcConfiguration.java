/**
 * <p>BigMemory configuration - size based config using Automatic Resource Control and dynamically adding one instance
 * so they share the memory allocated by Automatic Resource Control
 * <p/>
 * <p>Automatic Resource Control (ARC) is an intelligent approach to caching with fine-grained controls for tuning cache performance. ARC offers a wealth of benefits, including:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Sizing limitations on in-memory caches to avoid OutOfMemory errors</li>
 * <li>Pooled (CacheManager-level) sizing â€“ no requirement to size caches individually</li>
 * <li>Differentiated tier-based sizing for flexibility</li>
 * <li>Sizing by bytes, entries, or percentages for more flexibility</li>
 * <li>Keeping hot or eternal data where it can substantially boost performance</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>The two instances share 128 MB
 * <p/>
