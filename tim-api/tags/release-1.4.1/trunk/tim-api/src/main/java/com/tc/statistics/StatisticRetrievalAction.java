 * This interface has to be implemented to retrieve statistics data from system.

 * statistics infrastructure.
 *
 * The accent is really situated on the 'retrieval' part. Usually, a
 * {@code StatisticRetrievalAction} implementation will interact with
 * another part of the system that is responsible for measuring and sampling
 * the data itself.
 *
 * SRA classes are instantiated only once within the agent that they
 * belong to. The instances are shared amongst statistics capture sessions. Therefore,
 * SRA classes should not have any non-final instance state.
