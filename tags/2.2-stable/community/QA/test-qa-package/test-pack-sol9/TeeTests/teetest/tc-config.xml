        <!-- YOU MUST CHANGE THIS TO RUN JDBC DEMOS.
        
             If you want to run JDBC demos, you need to do two things:
             
               (a) enable JDBC here, by setting 'jdbc-enabled' to 'true';
               (b) uncomment the 'application' section below, and 
                   fill in the hostname of your database under 
                   'database/listener/host'.
             
             You'll also need to make sure you pass correct database connection
             information to the script that runs each JDBC demo.
